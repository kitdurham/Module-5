# HOMEWORK MODULE 5

# Create a tuple named pokemon with the three strings as its elements 
pokemon = ('picachu', 'charmander', 'bulbasaur')

# Using index notation, print() the string that located at index 1 in pokemon
print(pokemon[1])  # prints 'charmander'

# Unpack the values of pokemon into three new variables with names starter1, starter2, starter3. Print each variable using the print() function to verify the unpacking.
starter1, starter2, starter3 = pokemon
print(starter1)  # prints 'picachu'
print(starter2)  # prints 'charmander'
print(starter3)  # prints 'bulbasaur'
